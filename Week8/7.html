Please be more clear on what you want us to add (ie, add DOM elements within the div#div1 or outside of it.) Also, if the code is supposed to display an appended statement to "This is new.", this current code does not work so please make sure the code works before posting it for us to use. Right now, I am not sure if this code is working as intended or not since you did not specify what kind of result we should be looking for.
